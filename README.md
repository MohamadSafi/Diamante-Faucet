# Diamante Faucet 🚰💎

A simple, stylish, and functional faucet for the Diamante Blockchain. ✨

## Why I Built This 😄

I was messing around with the Diamante chain, needed some test tokens, Googled "Diamante Faucet," and found nothing. So I thought, "Fine, I’ll make one!" And here we are—just me having fun building something cool. 🚀

## Features 🌟

This is a single-page React application, designed with Diamante's styling guidelines and theme in mind. The faucet provides the following options to request test tokens:

1. **🔑 Enter Your Public Key**: Provide your public key, and the faucet will send test tokens directly to it.
2. **🔗 Connect DIAM Wallet**: Seamlessly connect your Diamante wallet, and receive test tokens instantly.
3. **🆕 Generate a New Key Pair**: If you don't have a wallet, the faucet can generate a new key pair for you and send test tokens to the newly created address.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **🖱️ Choose an Option**: Select one of the three options provided in the form.
2. **📤 Submit the Request**: Depending on your choice:
   - Enter your public key manually.
   - Connect your DIAM Wallet.
   - Generate a new key pair.
3. **📥 Receive Test Tokens**: The app processes your request and sends test tokens to the specified wallet or generated address.

## Future Improvements 🚧

- 📝 Integrating a transaction history feature.
